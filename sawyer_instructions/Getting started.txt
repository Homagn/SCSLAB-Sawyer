http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/intera/Workstation_Setup
(note above website is dead. See pdf in this directory)

2. Install sawyer gazebo from this link:
http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/intera/Gazebo_Tutorial
(note above website is dead. See pdf in this directory)

3. In ubuntu open a new terminal :ctrl+alt+t
type: cd ros_ws
type: source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
type: ./intera.sh sim 
type: roslaunch sawyer_gazebo sawyer_world.launch electric_gripper:=true
Done!, you are now in the intera simulation terminal

WARNING! - Never upgrade the intera SDK toolkit on your local machine, then you have to upgrade it on sawyer too and its a painful process
