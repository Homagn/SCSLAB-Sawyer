make sure the emergency stop is released, press the power button and start the robot.

start a terminal and :
cd ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roscore

start a new terminal and:
cd ros_ws
source devel/setup.bash
./intera.sh
(now you are connected to the robot, you can check local connectivity by typing ping 10.24.250.23)

Got to indera sdk examples website and then you can start the joint position control example.
