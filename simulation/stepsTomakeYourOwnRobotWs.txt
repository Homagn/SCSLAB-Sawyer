First download the git repository which contains all the launch and the urdf files related to the robot
Genrally they will contain two important folders-- robot_gazebo and robot_description, inside which again you will find launch, world and launch,meshes,urdf respectively
Now create your own directory in home, and name it say my_robot
cd myrobot
mkdir src
cd ..
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make
This will link ros to your folder and create two additional folders build and devel
cd src
catkin_create_pkg mybot_gazebo
go inside the recently created mybot_gazebo folder and paste launch and worlds folder from the robot_gazebo folder inside the github downloaded folder 
cd ..
catkin_create_pkg mybot_description
go inside the recently created mybot_description folder and paste launch,urdf and meshes folders from the robot_description folder inside the github downloaded folder 
navigate back to ros_ws/my_robot
test successful compilation by typing : roslaunch mybot_description mybot_rviz.launch or whatever name the launch file has
